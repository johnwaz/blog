                <p>Hello, I am John Wasielewicz. It's not easy to admit to people you don't know, or people you do know for that matter, how being a former alcoholic for close to 20 years has drastically impacted your life in many ways. Currently I have been sober for over six years now and spent the last few years on the coding journey of becoming a developer. During that time frame I have been learning programming skills such as Java, Spring, Hibernate, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I am presently on the track of learning React and will be sharing the lessons in this blog. Surely it will evolve into other things throughout the course of time.</p>
                <p>If you're like me, blogging has not particularly been an interest except for running across them while looking up information. I have been advised to create a blog by someone who deceivingly seemed at first like a unique individual. It is very interesting to know that they have a company which is respected by software developers. This person can perfectly be described by what the Urban Dictionary has listed as one of the definitions of a "<a class="man-thot" href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/author.php?author=HeadSandwichMaker" target="_blank">man thot</a>". Typically I never write anything bad about people, but I would most likely not be doing this if it wasn't for them. I have to give credit for that alone.<br></p>
                <p>So if you happen to be reading this one day, whoever you are, please do not judge me for any ignorance of not knowing or understanding things your particular way. I have been trying to the best of my ability to better myself in more ways than just programming.</p>
